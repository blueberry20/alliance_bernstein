An interview test for Alliance Bernstein

I was presented with a photoshop file and font files to convert design to code.

The page took me about 8 hours to complete.
I coded html and css according to design, and added media queries to convert design into responsive layout.

I didn't use any libraries, and set up a 12 column grid layout using css flexbox.
